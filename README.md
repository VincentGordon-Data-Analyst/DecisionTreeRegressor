# Data Collection

To start, web scraping was used to gather information on each house that is listed on the site. For this project, only data on houses that ranged from $300, 000 to $3 million were collected. Using an API and the address of each listing, both latitude and longitude coordinates were collected (later used for Tableau). Finally, the gathered data was cleaned using Pandas in JupyterNotebook leaving a csv file with 1015 rows of data.
